    <p>Privacy Policy
Last Updated: 9-10-2025
This Privacy Policy describes how My Coloring Book ("we," "our," or "us") handles information for our mobile application (the "App").
We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains our practices concerning information in relation to our App.
1. Information We Do Not Collect
We want to assure our users that My Coloring Book is designed to be a safe and private experience, especially for children and families.
We do not knowingly collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:
Name
Email address
Physical address
Phone number
Precise geolocation data
Any other information that can directly identify you
2. Third-Party Advertising (Unity Ads)
Our App uses Unity Technologies' advertising service ("Unity Ads") to display rewarded video ads. These ads allow you to voluntarily watch a video in exchange for in-app rewards (e.g., unlocking a premium feature or receiving in-app currency).
To show relevant ads, Unity Ads may collect certain information automatically from your device. This information is non-personal and is used for advertising purposes under their own privacy policy.
Information Unity may collect includes:
Advertising ID: A unique, user-resettable ID provided by your device's operating system (Google's Advertising ID on Android).
Device Information: Non-personal information such as your device type, operating system, language setting, and network status.
Ad Performance Data: Information about the delivery and performance of ads, such as how many times an ad has been shown, clicked, or viewed.
This data is used for:
Delivering and managing rewarded video ads.
Limiting the number of times you see the same ad.
Providing and measuring ad performance.
Interest-based advertising (showing ads they believe are relevant to you).
We have no control over and are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices of Unity Technologies. We encourage you to review Unity's privacy policy to understand their practices:Unity Privacy Policy
You can learn more about your advertising choices and how to opt-out of personalized ads from Unity by visiting their opt-out page: Unity Opt-Out
3. Local Data Storage
All your creative work, including your coloring pages, saved artwork, and in-app preferences, is stored locally only on your device. We do not upload, store, or have access to your artwork. It is your responsibility to ensure you do not lose this data; we recommend backing up your device regularly.
4. Children's Privacy
My Coloring Book is intended for a general audience and is suitable for users of all ages, including children.
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant regulations, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with any personal information, please contact us, and we will promptly take steps to delete such information.
5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
6. Your Consent
By using our App, you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, specifically the processing of non-personal data by Unity Ads for advertising purposes as outlined.
